The KVLargeObject interface defines the operations used to read and write
Large Objects (LOBs) such as audio and video files. As a general rule, any
object larger than 1 MB is a good candidate for representation as a LOB.
The LOB API permits access to large values, without having to materialize
the value in its entirety by providing streaming APIs for reading and
writing these objects.
